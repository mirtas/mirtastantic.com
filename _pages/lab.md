Welcome to the FACE lab! 

Our lab’s broad aim is to understand the wide individual differences in various aspects of human vision, particularly focusing on high levels of visual processing of objects and faces. 

We approach this aim by investigating how we can utilise existing and new emerging technologies to benefit our understanding of the high-level visual processing in humans. The previous and current work of our lab relies on available computer vision algorithms that allow our research to move away from neurotypical human perception and investigate atypical behavior in a richer way. 

We are currently interesting in investigating how faces are learnt over time and how this process can be fine-tuned to help those who struggle to acquire these long-term representations of other people. We are working on understanding how to better measure a variety of face processing abilities, but our ultimate interest lies in developing scaleable programmes to help children and adults who struggle with face processing in everyday life.
