I am interested in our visual systemâ€™s ability to recognize people from their faces, and its remarkable occasional failures to do so. Consequently, I study individual differences in face perception and face memory across populations.

How come some of us are so great at recognizing faces in everyday life, while others struggle so much? How does your ability to recognize that a face belongs to someone relate to your ability to remember them?

I use various cognitive, computational and neural methods to find answers to these questions. I have a DPhil from the University of Oxford, where I have worked with Geoffrey Bird and Caroline Catmur at the [Lab for Clinical Social Cognition](https://sites.google.com/site/geoffbirdlab/home). Before moving to the UK, I worked as a data analyst at Facebook and finished my undergraduate degree at Harvard University, where I worked with George Alvarez and Ken Nakayama at the [Harvard Vision Lab](https://visionlab.harvard.edu/).
